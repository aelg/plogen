Plogen is an autonomous labyrinth robot built by 6 students from
Link√∂ping University as part of the course TSEA27.

Plogen has four wheels, three ATmega16 microprocessors, five IR
distance sensors, a bluetooth module and a photo diode sensor for
reading marks on the floor, see plogen.jpg.

Plogen can autonomously drive through a labyrinth and fetch objects,
which it brings back to its origin.
